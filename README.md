# ChoucairTest
Hi! :raising_hand: My name is ***Sebasti√°n Prieto***. I solved the technical challenge about automation that was proposed by Choucair Testing S.A.

Here, you will find the solution and some considerations.
- User stories are completely in English and using the **Gherkin** language. You can find them in **userRegister.feature**.
- This solution used the **ScreenPlay** design patern which follows the development methodology called **BDD**.
- **Cucumber** was the tool that I used to work on this project.
- The solution is archetyped and organized by packages.
- Most of the elements were mapped using the xpath locator.

Thank you for this opportunity!
